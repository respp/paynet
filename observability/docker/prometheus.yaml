# Prometheus Configuration
# ========================
# Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects and stores metrics (numerical data)
# from applications and infrastructure. It works by "scraping" (pulling) metrics
# from configured endpoints at regular intervals.
#
# Key Concepts:
# - Scraping: Prometheus actively pulls metrics from target endpoints
# - Jobs: Groups of similar targets (e.g., all web servers)
# - Targets: Individual endpoints that expose metrics
# - Labels: Key-value pairs that help identify and filter metrics

# GLOBAL SETTINGS: Apply to all scraping jobs unless overridden
global:
  # How often Prometheus collects metrics from all targets
  scrape_interval: 15s
  # How often Prometheus evaluates alerting rules (if any)
  evaluation_interval: 15s

# SCRAPE CONFIGURATIONS: Define what endpoints Prometheus should collect metrics from
scrape_configs:
  # JOB 1: Collect Paynet-specific metrics from OpenTelemetry Collector
  # This captures metrics from our Paynet application
  - job_name: 'paynet-metrics'
    static_configs:
      # The OpenTelemetry Collector exposes Prometheus-format metrics on port 8889
      - targets: ['otel-collector:8889']
    
    # METRIC FILTERING: Only keep metrics that start with "paynet_"
    # This ensures we only store metrics relevant to our application
    metric_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__name__]        # Look at the metric name
        regex: 'paynet_.*'               # Match names starting with "paynet_"
        action: keep                     # Keep matching metrics, drop everything else

  # JOB 2: Collect other OpenTelemetry metrics (system metrics, collector metrics, etc.)
  # This captures infrastructure and collector performance metrics
  - job_name: 'other-opentelemetry'
    static_configs:
      # Same endpoint as above, but different filtering rules
      - targets: ['otel-collector:8889']
    
    # METRIC FILTERING: Drop Paynet metrics (we already collect them in job 1)
    # This prevents duplicate storage of the same metrics
    metric_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__name__]        # Look at the metric name
        regex: 'paynet_.*'               # Match names starting with "paynet_"
        action: drop                     # Drop matching metrics, keep everything else
